I am JerichoTorrent, owner and sole proprietor of Torrent Network, a Network of Minecraft servers running on Velocity. I am learning Java, php and node.js as a complete noob, but have much more experience designing 3D models, 
making resource packs, datapacks, Minecraft server administration, and other such things. You can check out my public network at the IP - torrentsmp.com  

My server supports Java and Bedrock edition on pretty much any version you want to play on.  

Also, this repo is for my ItemsAdder pack, because I didn't want to create a whole new repo for it.
