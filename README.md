I am JerichoTorrent, owner and sole proprietor of Torrent Network, a Network of Minecraft servers. I like to build full-stack web deployments using React + Typescript. I am learning a bit of Java to code Minecraft plugins for my server. You can check out my public network at the IP - `torrentsmp.com`  

My server supports Java and Bedrock edition on pretty much any version you want to play on.  

I use my github profile repo for dispatching my Minecraft resource pack to users who join my server network, as well as my web deployments and a few plugins.
