Howdy devs. I am JerichoTorrent, owner and sole proprietor of Torrent Network, a Network of Minecraft servers running on Velocity. I am learning java as a complete noob, but have much more experience designing 3D models, 
making resource packs, datapacks, server administration, and other such things. You can check out my public network at the IP - torrentsmp.com

My server supports Java and Bedrock edition on pretty much any version you want to play on.

Also, this repo is for my ItemsAdder pack, because I didn't want to create a whole new repo for it.
