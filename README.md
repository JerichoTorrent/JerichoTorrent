I am JerichoTorrent, owner and sole proprietor of Torrent Network, a Network of Minecraft servers running on Velocity. I am learning Java, php and node.js as a complete noob, but have much more experience designing 3D models, making resource packs, datapacks, Minecraft server administration, and other such things. You can check out my public network at the IP - `torrentsmp.com`  

My server supports Java and Bedrock edition on pretty much any version you want to play on.  

I use my github profile repo for dispatching my Minecraft resource pack to users who join my server network.
