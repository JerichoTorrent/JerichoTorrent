I am JerichoTorrent, owner and sole proprietor of Torrent Network, a Network of Minecraft servers. I like to build full-stack web deployments using React + VITE + Typescript mainly. I am learning a bit of Java to code Minecraft plugins for my server. You can check out my public network at the IP - `torrentsmp.com`  

My server supports Java and Bedrock edition on pretty much any version you want to play on.  

I am a firm believer in free and open source software. If you want to jump in to any of my projects and make PRs, I will be happy to consider them.
